# Kubernetes Extra

This directory contains all the note pieces I have on Kubernetes. These notes are not taking while reading the book *Kubernetes in Action 2nd Edition*. Instead, all notes here are took while reading k8s documentation in my daily work. When I need to figure out something, I think it will be better to take a note to help my learning.
